This is a double pendule simulation where u can change every parameters and this give u a gif file.
This is not accelerate, this is a real time modelisation.
if u change precise parameters (n,dt, etc..), some errors can occurs due to the int value for fps (than can't be an int for every values of other variables).
be aware of troncation and rounding errors.
If ur computer is not a good one (like me) dont try to simulate more than 10 pendulum with these parameters. (It took me almost one hour for calculation and 30 min for animate it...)

Have fun with this !! give me some feedbacks.
